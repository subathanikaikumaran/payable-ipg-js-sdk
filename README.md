    if (error.code === 3009) { // field validation error
      error.fields.forEach((field) => {
        console.log(field.error)

#### Listening to Payment Notification Data

Payable Payment Gateway will send back to your website notifies the payment status to the `notify_url`. You need to get the request and send the response.

- It cannot test the payment notification by print/echo methods since `notify_url` never 
loads to the browser as it's a server callback. You can only test it by updating your database upon 
fetching the notification.
- It cannot test the payment notification on localhost. You need to submit a publicly accessible IP or 
domain based URL as your `notify_url` is to directly notify your server.
- No payment status parameters are passed to the `return_url` when redirecting the customer 
back to the Merchant’s website. You need to update your database upon fetching payment status by 
your script on `notify_url` & then show the payment status to the customer in the page on 
`return_url` by fetching the status from your database.
